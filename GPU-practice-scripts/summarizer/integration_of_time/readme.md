A model of the brain as a real time system processing node and as an independent core in a system of graphs rewarded by time-persistence (survival). 

The brain performs and has performed many functions. It has rissen to the occassion across epochs and mastered its environment. This is accomplished
through an interrupt based processing system governing the focus mechanism. The brain seeks to balance electrical flow across its synapses to perform
load balancing. The human-machine interface is also a load balancing protocol. 

This thesis will leverage the visual cortex of the reader to explain the pattern recognition and prediction viewpoint of the human neocortex. 

A hardware-in-the-loop modeling environment is set forward as well and its function described by SysML.
