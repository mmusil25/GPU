# Summarizer
Welcome to my Summarizer project. I created this as an introduction to Natural Language Processing using Python's nltk library. This application aimes to create a summary from a given text/article/journal/story through sentence fragmentation and keyword idetification on weighted keywords. The project is still in progress but is built with HTML5, Bootstrap and Python (flask and nltk).

Feel free to browse the code and check out the page. Default port is set to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
